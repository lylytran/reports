# AFL - Fuzz

### 0. Structure

- Input Types: `bool`, `address`, `string`, `bytes<M>`, `uint<M>`,Â `int<M>`, `<type>[M]`, `<type>[]`, `<type>[M][N]`, `type[M][]`, `type[][]`

- All input type can be converted to bytes

### 1. Objective Function

- Detecting new behaviors

- Inputs that do not trigger new local-scale state transitions in the execution trace (i.e., produce no new tuples) are discarded, even if their overall control flow sequence is unique

- Example:

  #1: A -> B -> C -> D -> E

  #2: A -> B -> C -> A -> E

  #3: A -> B -> C -> A -> B -> C -> A -> B -> C -> D -> E (discard)

### 2. Mutation

- <u>**Calibration**</u> - a pre-fuzzing stage where the execution path is examined to detect anomalies, establish baseline execution speed, and so on. Executed very briefly whenever a new find is being made.
- **<u>Trim L/S</u>** - another pre-fuzzing stage where the test case is trimmed to the shortest form that still produces the same execution path. The length (L) and stepover (S) are chosen in general relationship to file size.
- **<u>Bitflip L/S</u>** - deterministic bit flips. There are L bits toggled at any given time, walking the input file with S-bit increments. The current L/S variants are: 1/1, 2/1, 4/1, 8/8, 16/8, 32/8.
  - Single walking bit
  - Two walking bits.
  - Four walking bits.
  - Walking byte.
  - Two walking bytes.
  - Four walking bytes
- **<u>Arith L/8</u>** - deterministic arithmetics. The fuzzer tries to subtract or add small integers to 8-, 16-, and 32-bit values. The stepover is always 8 bits.
  -  8-bit arithmetics
  - 16-bit arithmetics, both endians
  - 32-bit arithmetics, both endians.
- **Interest L/8** - deterministic value overwrite. The fuzzer has a list of known "interesting" 8-, 16-, and 32-bit values to try. The stepover is 8 bits.
  - Setting 8-bit integers.
  - Setting 16-bit integers, both endians
  - Setting 32-bit integers, both endians
- <u>**Extras**</u> - deterministic injection of dictionary terms. This can be shown as "user" or "auto", depending on whether the fuzzer is using a user-supplied dictionary (-x) or an auto-created one. You will also see "over" or "insert", depending on whether the dictionary words overwrite existing data or are inserted by offsetting the remaining data to accommodate their length.
  - Overwrite with user-supplied extras.
  - Insertion of user-supplied extras.
- **<u>Havoc</u>** - a sort-of-fixed-length cycle with stacked random tweaks. The operations attempted during this stage include bit flips, overwrites with random and "interesting" integers, block deletion, block duplication, plus assorted dictionary-related operations (if a dictionary is supplied in the first place).
  - Flip a single bit somewhere
  - Set byte to interesting value
  - Set word to interesting value, randomly choosing endian
  - Set dword to interesting value, randomly choosing endian
  - Randomly subtract from byte
  - Randomly add to byte.
  - Randomly subtract from word, random endian.
  - Randomly add to word, random endian.
  - Randomly subtract from dword, random endian.
  - Randomly add to dword, random endian.
  - set a random byte to a random value
  - Delete bytes
  - Clone bytes (75%) or insert a block of constant bytes (25%)
  - Overwrite bytes with a randomly selected chunk (75%) or fixed bytes (25%).
  - Overwrite bytes with an extra
  - Insert an extra
- **<u>Splice</u>** - a last-resort strategy that kicks in after the first full queue cycle with no new paths. It is equivalent to 'havoc', except that it first splices together two random inputs from the queue at some arbitrarily selected midpoint.
- **<u>Sync</u>** - a stage used only when -M or -S is set (see parallel_fuzzing.txt). No real fuzzing is involved, but the tool scans the output from other fuzzers and imports test cases as necessary. The first time this is done, it may take several minutes or so.

### 3. Done

- **<u>Objective functions</u>**
- **<u>Bitflip L/S</u>**
- **<u>Arith L/8</u>**
- **Interest L/8**
